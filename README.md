# School_District_Analysis
## Overview:
  In this challange we were asked by the school board to analyze various aspects of information for 15 schools in a particular disctrict. We were able to analyze standardize testing results for each grade level in each school, and see what affects the scores with certain variables, such as budget per student or school size or school type. As we were working through this analysis we were notified that there had been some academic dishonesty in the reading and math testing results from the ninth-graders in a particular school, Thomas High School. In order to keep the data fair we were asked to remove all the math and reading scores from the ninth-graders at Thomas High School. We will now explore how this deletion of data affected the schools overall scores and how it compares to other schools.
  
## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

* When it comes to the district summary for this analysis, one can say it did not affect the data at all. This can be contributed to the fact that the 9th grade class of Thomas High School was rather a small number of students; a total of 461 students which comes out to approximately 1.18% of the total number of students in the district. This had visible effect for this summary analysis, which can be seen below, as the first image shows the district summary without the ninth-grade class and the one following shows all students accounted for (this particular summary was taken from the work on the module data).

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
